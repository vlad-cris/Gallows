"""
Gallows
To create the classic game of hangman. In this game a word is chosen and the user has to guess this word.

At first, the user will only see the number of letters that make up the word, and a horizontal line (_) will be displayed for each letter in the bracket.

The user will guess one letter at a time from a to z. For each correctly guessed letter, the horizontal line with the guessed letter will be replaced on each of the positions in the word where that letter appears.

For each guessed letter that is not in the word, the user will lose a life.

The user has a count of 7 lives.

At the end of the game display on the page (so no alert or console.log) an appropriate message depending on whether the game is won or lost.

It is not necessary to make the actual drawing of the gallows.
